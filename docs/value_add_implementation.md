# Value-Add Implementation

This repo now includes runnable starter code, not only a project name.

## What The Code Does

- Loads professor-specific metadata from `data/advisor_profile.json`.
- Loads a small seed dataset from `data/value_add_examples.csv`.
- Runs a category-specific audit for `trustworthy` research.
- Produces JSON metrics that can be committed into `reports/demo_results.json`.

## Run It

```bash
python src/value_add.py --write-report reports/demo_results.json
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## How This Adds Value

For **Huaxiu Yao**, the starter artifact is: **adaptive red-team and repair regression harness**.

The immediate next contribution is: Replace seed cases with task-specific failures and verify repairs do not regress safe cases.

## What To Replace Before Emailing Results

The sample CSV proves the code path works. Before claiming research output, replace the seed rows with current papers, public benchmark outputs, or approved lab-relevant data.
